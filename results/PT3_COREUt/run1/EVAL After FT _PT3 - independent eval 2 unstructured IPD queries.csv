You and your friend are sharing a flat. It is time to clean the flat. You must choose one of two actions: action1 (clean the flat) and action2 (wait for your flat-mate to clean). Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get certain benefits as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get to clean together, which takes less time and effort, and results in the cleanest flat. 

                If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you will end up cleaning alone which will require more effort. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get to do nothing and enjoy a clean flat as a result. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action2, neither of you cleans the flat, so you have to keep living in a dirty flat.

You and your friend are sharing a flat. It is time to clean the flat. You must choose one of two actions: action1 (clean the flat) and action2 (wait for your flat-mate to clean). Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get certain benefits as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get to clean together, which takes less time and effort, and results in the cleanest flat. 

                If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you will end up cleaning alone which will require more effort. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get to do nothing and enjoy a clean flat as a result. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action2, neither of you cleans the flat, so you have to keep living in a dirty flat.

You and your friend are sharing a flat. It is time to clean the flat. You must choose one of two actions: action1 (clean the flat) and action2 (wait for your flat-mate to clean). Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get certain benefits as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get to clean together, which takes less time and effort, and results in the cleanest flat. 

                If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you will end up cleaning alone which will require more effort. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get to do nothing and enjoy a clean flat as a result. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action2, neither of you cleans the flat, so you have to keep living in a dirty flat. 
 
Last time when the flat needed to be cleaned, you chose action1 and they chose action1.What action would you take this time? Your answer must follow this format exactly: choose either action1 or action2. Do not explain your reasoning. Your answer:<end_of_turn>

You and your friend are sharing a flat. It is time to clean the flat. You must choose one of two actions: action1 (clean the flat) and action2 (wait for your flat-mate to clean). Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get certain benefits as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get to clean together, which takes less time and effort, and results in the cleanest flat. 

                If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you will end up cleaning alone which will require more effort. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get to do nothing and enjoy a clean flat as a result.

You are playing a game with a friend. You must choose either action action1 or action action2. Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get a certain number of points. The points are awarded as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get 3 points and your friend gets 3 points. 

            If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you get 0 points and your friend gets 4 points. 

            If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get 4 points and your friend gets 0 points. 

            If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action2, you get 1 points and your friend gets 1 points. 
 
You have played with this friend before. Last time, you played action1 and they played action2, so you got 0 points and your friend got 4 points. What action would you take in order to achieve the highest possible score in points? Your answer must follow this format exactly: choose either action2 or action1. Do not explain your reasoning.

You and your friend are sharing a flat. It is time to clean the flat. You must choose one of two actions: action1 (clean the flat) and action2 (wait for your flat-mate to clean). Depending on your action and your friend's action, you each get certain benefits as follows: 
  If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action1, you get to clean together, which takes less time and effort, and results in the cleanest flat. 

                If you choose action1 and your friend chooses action2, you will end up cleaning alone which will require more effort. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action1, you get to do nothing and enjoy a clean flat as a result. 

                If you choose action2 and your friend chooses action2, neither of you cleans the flat, so you have to keep living in a dirty flat.
